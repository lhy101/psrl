"""
Resolve the source line of each injected defect, and cache it per environment.

`_build_hint` needs a line number for the strongest hint level, and not every env
records one. `authoring/provenance.json` stores the defect as a literal `old` text
block, so locating that block in the pinned upstream file gives the line exactly.

A recorded `candidate.meta.line` always wins and is never written to the cache, so the
cache holds only the lines the env itself is missing. Output goes to
`envs/<env>/factory/DEFECT_LINES.json` to keep `build_dataset.py` offline. Re-run this
only when the task bank changes.
